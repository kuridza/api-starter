# API starter

Simple silex api.

Setup
-----
* clone or download
* get dependencies:
```bash
$ composer install
```
* setup web server to run on index.php or run php build-in web server:
```bash
$ php -S localhost:8000
```
* open in browser `localhost:8000` for routes list
* run tests:
```bash
$ php tests.php
```
OR

open `tests.php` in browser. Note that build-in server can't handle multiple request so run another instance and try tests on `localhost:8001/tests.php`
